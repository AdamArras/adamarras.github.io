Sience outreach
------

In 2023, I participated in the project "[Regards de Géomètre](https://lesmathsenscene.fr/regards-de-geometre/)", organized by Les Maths en Scène. The aim was to combine mathematics and artistic creation. The [slides](/files/rdg.pdf) from my presentation, intended for high school students, can be found here (in french). 

A selection of books I’ve particularly enjoyed. I would be happy to receive recommendations in a similar spirit.
------


* Albert Lautman - La pensée mathématique et la réalité physique (1952)

* Alain Badiou - Éloge des mathématiques (2013)

* Richard P. Feynman, Robert B. Leighton, and Matthew Sands - The Feynman Lectures on Physics (1964)

* Saunders MacLane - Mathematics: Form and Function (1986)

* Donella H. Meadows, Dennis L. Meadows, Jørgen Randers, and William W. Behrens - The Limits to Growth (1972)


Online contents
------

There are some high-quality online courses available. Among them, I recommend [Xavier Viennot](https://www.viennot.org/abjc.html)'s course on bijective combinatorics and [Frederic P. Schuller](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPH7f_7ZlzxTi6kS4vCmv4ZKm9u8g5yic)'s course on the mathematical foundations of theoretical physics.
