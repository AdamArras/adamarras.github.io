I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [DYNASNET](https://dynasnet.renyi.hu/) group at the [Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics](https://www.renyi.hu/), working with [Miklós Abért](https://users.renyi.hu/~abert/) and [Gábor Pete](https://math.bme.hu/~gabor/) since September 2023. I graduated from Aix-Marseille University where I did my PhD under the supervision [Charles Bordenave](https://www.i2m.univ-amu.fr/perso/charles.bordenave/). During the 2022–2023 academic year, I held an ATER (Teaching and Research Assistant) position at Aix-Marseille University.

My research focuses on the properties of large graphs and networks, at the intersection of probability, geometry, and spectral analysis.

You can reach me at arras[at]renyi[dot]hu.
