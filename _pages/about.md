I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [DYNASNET](https://dynasnet.renyi.hu/) group at the [Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics](https://www.renyi.hu/), working with [Miklós Abért](https://users.renyi.hu/~abert/). I completed my PhD at Aix-Marseille University under the supervision of [Charles Bordenave](https://www.i2m.univ-amu.fr/perso/charles.bordenave/), after graduating from École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay (formerly ENS Cachan, Master MVA). In 2022–2023, I held a position as ATER (Teaching and Research Assistant) at Aix-Marseille University.

My research lies at the intersection of probability, geometry, and spectral analysis, focusing on the properties of large graphs and networks.

You can reach me at arras[at]renyi[dot]hu.
